# CIS2107 - Computer Systems & Low-Level Programming (Temple University)

- **Lab 02: Paycheck & Revenue** – C program performing arithmetic operations, formatted I/O, and simple control structures.  
- **Lab 03: ATM Machine** – C program that simulates an ATM machine, featuring PIN validation, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal and deposit with daily limits, and receipt prompts
- **Lab 04: Processing 1D Arrays** - Implements 1D array utilities: fill with random ints (min–max), find max in an index range (ANSI-color highlight), reverse whole array and selected subranges, and detect a two-number sequence
- **Lab 05: Processing 2D Arrays** - Implements functions to process 2D arrays: find maximum element, compute row/column sums, check if array is square, and display formatted output. Includes runtime-sized array allocation and modular function design
- **Lab 06: Array of Pointers to Functions** - C program demonstrating function pointer arrays to process a 2D grades array with menu-driven operations: print array, find minimum/maximum grades, and calculate student averages using variable-length arrays
- **Lab 07: Race (Tortoise vs. Hare Simulation)** - C program simulating the classic tortoise and hare race on a 70-square track using random number generation, pointer parameters for position updates, probability-based movement logic, and animated terminal output with collision detection
- **Lab 09: Manual** - Comprehensive C program implementing 14 string manipulation functions using pointers: case conversion, string-to-numeric conversion, string comparison, random sentence generation, telephone number tokenization, substring/character counting, word reversal, alphabetic frequency analysis, and pattern matching (strings starting with "b" or ending with "ed")
